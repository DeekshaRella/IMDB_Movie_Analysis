# IMDB_Movie_Analysis

The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is a website that serves as an online database of world cinema and contains a significant amount of publicly available information on films, including the title of the film, the year it was released, the genre of the film, the audience, budget, and earnings as well as information on the length, cast, and crew.

Examine the information on IMDB for motion pictures published between 2000 and 2019.

Our investigation will provide answers to the following queries: Which genres have the most films? What subgenres have expensive production costs? Which genres are the most lucrative?

Data exploration: After looking for data online, we extracted raw data using the IMDB database and an API key. This database has a lot of unstructured material that needs to be cleaned up and organised before it can be used for research and education.

Data cleaning: Data inventory choosing data film genre, year, budget, and revenue HTML, CSS, and Javascript make up the IMDB code. After parsing and recovering the data, we created a csv file and JSON for analysis. python script was used to scrape data Python script has been updated to ignore movies with incomplete data.

Analysis method To get a general overview of the datasets, use the pandas package. The categories that make up our statistical data analysis and modelling are as follows: Genre Cost/Revenue Score

Findings: Action, comedy, and drama make up over 62% of the titles. The remaining genres make up the remaining 38%. Adventure, Animation, Action, Fantasy, and Science Fiction make up 51% of the Total Mean Budget. The remaining genres make up the remaining 49%. Given the relevant genre, Mean Revenue and Mean Budget generally correlate favourably on a percentage basis. The genres of history, mystery, and horror offer the best value. For adventure movies, there is a fair amount of positive association between budget and profit, although many of them had profitability that was near to zero or even negative. Given this reality, producers should thoroughly investigate the market before creating an adventure movie.
